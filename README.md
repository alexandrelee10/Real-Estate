This project is a modern, responsive real estate website built to showcase property listings with a clean and intuitive user interface. The main focus was creating a well-structured front end with clear navigation, consistent spacing, and a layout that works smoothly across all screen sizes.

The site is built using React and Tailwind CSS, with reusable components and a scalable structure. It includes features like a sticky transparent navigation bar, light and dark theme support, and responsive sections designed with a mobile-first approach.

This project was built as a hands-on way to improve my front-end development skills, specifically working with component-based design, state management, and modern styling workflows. It also serves as a solid foundation for future features such as property filtering, search functionality, and backend integration.
